### **3.1 Material Properties and Geometric Parameters**

- **Yield Strength (\( F_y \))**: 235 MPa (\( 235 \times 10^6 \) Pa)
- **Modulus of Elasticity (\( E \))**: 200 GPa (\( 200 \times 10^9 \) Pa)
- **Angle of Tubes to Horizontal Plane (\( \theta_h \))**: Determined from geometry

**Determining the Angle (\( \theta_h \)) Between Tubes and Horizontal Plane:**

#### **Side Length of Hexagon (after overlap subtraction)**

$$
L_{\text{hex}} = 1.528\, \text{m} - 2 \times 0.030\, \text{m} = 1.468\, \text{m}
$$

#### **Radius of Ring 1 (\( r_1 \))**

$$
r_1 = \frac{ L_{\text{hex}} }{ 2 \times \sin\left( \dfrac{ \pi }{ 6 } \right) } = \frac{ 1.468 }{ 2 \times \sin\left( \dfrac{ \pi }{ 6 } \right) } = \frac{ 1.468 }{ 2 \times 0.5 } = 1.468\, \text{m}
$$

#### **Height from Center Point to Ring 1 (\( h_1 \))**

$$
h_1 = \sqrt{ L_A^2 - r_1^2 } = \sqrt{ 1.55^2 - 1.468^2 } = \sqrt{ 2.4025 - 2.1546 } = \sqrt{ 0.2479 } = 0.4989\, \text{m}
$$

#### **Angle to Horizontal (\( \theta_h \))**

$$
\theta_h = \arctan\left( \dfrac{ r_1 }{ h_1 } \right) = \arctan\left( \dfrac{ 1.468 }{ 0.4989 } \right) \approx 71.87^\circ
$$

### **3.2 Cross-Sectional Properties**

#### **a. Hollow Cylindrical Tubes**

**Outer Diameter (\( D_o \))**

$$
D_o = 0.048\, \text{m}
$$

**Inner Diameter (\( D_i \))**

$$
D_i = D_o - 2t = 0.048\, \text{m} - 2 \times 0.0025\, \text{m} = 0.043\, \text{m}
$$

**Cross-Sectional Area (\( A_{\text{tube}} \))**

$$
A_{\text{tube}} = \frac{\pi}{4} \left( D_o^2 - D_i^2 \right ) = \frac{\pi}{4} \left( 0.048^2 - 0.043^2 \right ) = 0.000357\, \text{m}^2
$$

**Moment of Inertia (\( I_{\text{tube}} \))**

$$
I_{\text{tube}} = \frac{\pi}{64} \left( D_o^4 - D_i^4 \right ) = 9.24 \times 10^{-8}\, \text{m}^4
$$

#### **b. Flat Compressed Ends**

**Width (\( b \))**

$$
b = 0.04\, \text{m}
$$

**Thickness (\( t \))**

$$
t = 0.005\, \text{m}
$$

**Cross-Sectional Area (\( A_{\text{flat}} \))**

$$
A_{\text{flat}} = b \times t = 0.04\, \text{m} \times 0.005\, \text{m} = 0.0002\, \text{m}^2
$$

**Moment of Inertia (\( I_{\text{flat}} \))**

$$
I_{\text{flat}} = \frac{ b t^3 }{ 12 } = \frac{ 0.04\, \text{m} \times (0.005\, \text{m})^3 }{ 12 } = 4.17 \times 10^{-10}\, \text{m}^4
$$

**Section Modulus (\( S_{\text{flat}} \))**

$$
S_{\text{flat}} = \frac{ I_{\text{flat}} }{ c } = \frac{ I_{\text{flat}} }{ t/2 } = \frac{ 4.17 \times 10^{-10}\, \text{m}^4 }{ 0.0025\, \text{m} } = 1.668 \times 10^{-7}\, \text{m}^3
$$

### **3.3 Bending Capacity of the Flat Ends**

**Maximum Bending Moment (\( M_{\text{max}} \)) Before Yielding**

$$
M_{\text{max}} = F_y \times S_{\text{flat}} = 235 \times 10^6\, \text{Pa} \times 1.668 \times 10^{-7}\, \text{m}^3 = 39.33\, \text{N}\cdot\text{m}
$$

**Assuming an Eccentricity (\( e \)) of 1 mm (0.001 m)**

**Maximum Axial Load (\( P_{\text{bending}} \)) Without Exceeding Bending Capacity**

$$
P_{\text{bending}} = \frac{ M_{\text{max}} }{ e } = \frac{ 39.33\, \text{N}\cdot\text{m} }{ 0.001\, \text{m} } = 39,333\, \text{N} = 39.33\, \text{kN}
$$

<a name="axial-capacity"></a>
### **3.4 Axial Capacity of the Tubes**

**Axial Yield Capacity (\( P_{\text{axial}} \)) of the Flat Ends**

$$
P_{\text{axial}} = A_{\text{flat}} \times F_y = 0.0002\, \text{m}^2 \times 235 \times 10^6\, \text{Pa} = 47,000\, \text{N} = 47\, \text{kN}
$$

**Conclusion:** Since \( P_{\text{bending}} < P_{\text{axial}} \), **bending governs the design**.

<a name="center-point-load"></a>
### **3.5 Calculation of Load Capacity at the Center Point**

**a. Vertical Load Contribution per Tube**

**Angle to Horizontal (\( \theta_h = 71.87^\circ \))**

**Secant of Angle (\( \sec(\theta_h) \))**

$$
\sec(\theta_h) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta_h)} = \frac{1}{\cos(71.87^\circ)} = \frac{1}{0.3145} = 3.178
$$

**Vertical Load per Tube (\( F_{\text{vertical}} \))**

$$
F_{\text{vertical}} = P_{\text{bending}} \times \sec(\theta_h) = 39.33\, \text{kN} \times 3.178 = 125.00\, \text{kN}
$$

**b. Total Load Capacity at Center Point**

**Number of Tubes (\( n = 6 \))**

**Total Vertical Load (\( P_{\text{total}} \))**

$$
P_{\text{total}} = n \times F_{\text{vertical}} = 6 \times 125.00\, \text{kN} = 750.00\, \text{kN}
$$

**Convert to Kilograms (\( g = 9.81\, \text{m/s}^2 \))**

$$
\text{Total Load Capacity} = \frac{ P_{\text{total}} }{ g } = \frac{ 750,000\, \text{N} }{ 9.81\, \text{m/s}^2 } \approx 76,455\, \text{kg}
$$

**c. Applying a Safety Factor**

**Assuming a Safety Factor of 2.0**

$$
\text{Safe Load Capacity} = \frac{ 76,455\, \text{kg} }{ 2.0 } = 38,227\, \text{kg}
$$

**d. Summary**

- **Maximum Load Before Bending (with Safety Factor):** Approximately **38,227 kg**

## **4. Strength of Other Points in the Dome**

<a name="load-distribution"></a>
### **4.1 Load Distribution in a Geodesic Dome**

- **Structural Interconnectivity:** The geodesic dome's network of triangles allows loads applied at any point to be distributed throughout the entire structure.
- **Redundancy:** Multiple load paths reduce the stress on individual members, enhancing overall strength.
- **Global Behavior:** The dome acts as an integrated whole rather than a collection of isolated elements.

<a name="increased-strength"></a>
### **4.2 Increased Strength at Other Points**

- **Lower-Stressed Areas:** Points further from the center typically experience less stress due to the dome's geometry and load distribution.
- **Angle of Inclination:** Tubes at other points may be more vertical, reducing bending stresses and increasing axial load capacity.
- **Additional Support:** Rings and interconnected members provide extra support, making these points stronger than the center point.

**Example:**

- **At Lower Points in the Dome:**
  - **Angles to Horizontal are Smaller**, meaning tubes are more vertical.
  - **Bending Moments are Reduced**, as eccentricities have less impact.
  - **Axial Loads are Supported More Efficiently**, increasing load capacity.

<a name="conservative-estimate"></a>
## **5. Conservative Nature of the Estimate**

<a name="load-sharing"></a>
### **5.1 Load Sharing and Structural Redundancy**

- **Conservative Calculations:** The analysis focuses on the weakest component (flat ends at the center point) without considering the dome's overall ability to distribute loads.
- **Load Redistribution:** In reality, the dome's geometry allows for load sharing among many members, reducing the load on any single component.
- **Safety Margin:** The calculated capacity is intentionally conservative to ensure safety.

<a name="potential-capacity"></a>
### **5.2 Potential for Higher Load Capacity**

- **Global Structural Analysis:** A comprehensive analysis considering all members and connections could reveal a higher load capacity.
- **Finite Element Analysis (FEA):** Using FEA software can model complex interactions and more accurately predict load capacities.
- **Inherent Strength of Geodesic Domes:** The dome's shape inherently distributes forces efficiently, potentially supporting greater loads than calculated in a localized analysis.

---

<a name="conclusion"></a>
## **6. Conclusion**

The calculated **safe load capacity at the center point** of the geodesic dome is approximately **38,227 kilograms**, considering the bending capacity of the flat compressed ends and applying a safety factor of 2.0. This estimate is conservative, focusing on the weakest component and not accounting for the dome's overall load distribution capabilities.

**Key Points:**

- **Bending Capacity Governs the Design:** The flat ends' susceptibility to bending under small eccentricities limits the load capacity.
- **Other Points are Stronger:** Due to structural redundancy and geometry, other points in the dome can support greater loads.
- **Load Distribution Enhances Capacity:** The dome's interconnected structure allows for load sharing, potentially increasing overall load capacity.
